[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.1.4-blue.svg)](https://postgresgui.com)
  [![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-macOS%2026-lightgrey.svg)](https://www.apple.com/macos)

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PostgresGUI/app.git
   cd app
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open PostgresGUI.xcodeproj
   ```

3. IMPORTANT: Configure code signing:
   - Select the **PostgresGUI** target in the project navigator
   - Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab
   - Select your **Team** from the dropdown (use your Apple ID's "Personal Team" if you don't have a paid developer account)

4. Build and run with `Cmd+R`

### Submitting Pull Requests

When you select your team in step 3, Xcode modifies `project.pbxproj` with your team ID. **Do not include this change in your pull request.**

### Why Code Signing is Required

This app uses macOS Keychain to securely store database passwords. Keychain access requires a valid code signature, so even local development builds need to be signed with your team ID.
